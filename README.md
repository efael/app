## Using Rust Inside Flutter

This project leverages Flutter for GUI and Rust for the backend logic,
utilizing the capabilities of the
[Rinf](https://pub.dev/packages/rinf) framework.

To run and build this app, you need to have
[Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
and [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
installed on your system.
You can check that your system is ready with the commands below.
Note that all the Flutter subcomponents should be installed.

```shell
rustc --version
flutter doctor
```

You also need to have the CLI tool for Rinf ready.

```shell
cargo install rinf_cli
```

Signals sent between Dart and Rust are implemented using signal attributes.
If you've modified the signal structs, run the following command
to generate the corresponding Dart classes:

```shell
rinf gen
```

Now you can run and build this app just like any other Flutter projects.

```shell
flutter run
```

For detailed instructions on writing Rust and Flutter together,
please refer to Rinf's [documentation](https://rinf.cunarist.com).
